##Answers to the following questions:

* What do you value in a career? What are the most important parts (rank if you feel its appropriate)?
  - The most important factor that I consider in a career is whether I enjoy doing it. Even if such tasks might take a lot of time and effort, as long as I find it enjoyable, I will be satisfied with the job.

* What is the ideal industry you would like to work in? Be as specific as you can (i.e. mobile apps, video game design, etc.)

* What job title is the closest to your ideal career? (i.e. Full-Stack developer, Technical Art Director, etc.)

* How does that industry/job title align with what you value in a career?

* How does that industry/job title align with what your personal interests are, if any?

* How does the job posting you found embody that?

* What is the ideal career path to get to that job posting, from where you are now? (i.e. what degree(s) do you need? internships? jobs? etc.)
