## Education
**Miracosta College** Computer Science - May 2018. 

## Skills
* Primary Language : Java

## Personal projects
Developed a Blackjack game program with three other group members. As a leader of the project, I distributed the works according to each person's strengths. Then gathered all parts and merged them together to make the program run. 


##Answers to the following questions:

* What do you value in a career? What are the most important parts (rank if you feel its appropriate)?
  - The most important factor that I consider in a career is whether I enjoy doing it. Even if such tasks might take a lot of time and effort, as long as I find it enjoyable, I will be satisfied with the job.
  - Employee's welfare is also critical. One thing that I felt while taking computer science courses in college and doing projects, it was inefficient to work on a desk for hours without break. Instead, having a break when I get stuck on a problem often helped me to come up with an idea that could solve the issues. That is why I try to give myself a break during the works and go to a differnt computer in the library and continue the work. I hope the company also respects these and provides a flexible working environment.
  - I would like to work on things that are beneficial to our daily lives. Although I don't have much coding experiences regarding building an actual program for other users, I felt object oriented programming languages like Java enables the users to achieve what they want easily. I wish other users benefit from my work.
  
* What is the ideal industry you would like to work in? Be as specific as you can (i.e. mobile apps, video game design, etc.)
  - I would like to work in game industries. To be specific, I want to participate in online game developing companies. I enjoy playing online computer games from childhood to now. The bugs in games often annoys me as a player. Thus as a game developer, I would like to build my own game and debug any issues by playing the game I built.
  
* What job title is the closest to your ideal career? (i.e. Full-Stack developer, Technical Art Director, etc.)
  - Game developer & server administrator

* How does that industry/job title align with what you value in a career?
  - First of all, I would truly enjoy myself working at a game company since I love playing online games. Also by debugging any possible issues, I would also provide enjoyment to other users who play our games.

* How does that industry/job title align with what your personal interests are, if any?

* How does the job posting you found embody that?

* What is the ideal career path to get to that job posting, from where you are now? (i.e. what degree(s) do you need? internships? jobs? etc.)
